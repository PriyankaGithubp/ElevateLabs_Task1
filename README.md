Java Console Calculator
small project on mathematical calculations Using loops , methods, conditional statements and oops.

The Java Console Calculator is a beginner-friendly application developed using core Java. It performs basic arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—through a simple menu-driven interface in the console.

Users interact with the application using Java’s Scanner class, and the calculator runs in a continuous loop until the user chooses to exit. This project helps new Java learners grasp key concepts like methods, input/output, loops, and control structures.

It is a lightweight tool that runs directly in the terminal and is ideal for practicing fundamental programming logic.
